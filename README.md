> NOTE: If you would like to support the project, please instead [donate to Aylur](https://ko-fi.com/aylur) who put in tremendous effort to build AGS. Hyprpanel likely wouldn't exist without it.

## Information

The [HyprPanel Wiki](https://hyprpanel.com/getting_started/installation.html) contains in depth instructions for configuring and installing the panel and all of its dependencies. The instructions below are just the general instructions for installing the panel.

**NOTE: HyprPanel will not run without the required dependencies.**

### Optional

## To control screen/keyboard brightness
brightnessctl

```

### Arch

pacman:

```bash
 sudo pacman -S --needed wireplumber libgtop bluez bluez-utils btop networkmanager dart-sass wl-clipboard brightnessctl swww python upower pacman-contrib power-profiles-daemon gvfs
```

AUR:

```bash
yay -S --needed aylurs-gtk-shell-git grimblast-git gpu-screen-recorder-git hyprpicker matugen-bin python-gpustat hyprsunset-git hypridle-git
```

### Fedora

COPR - Add [solopasha/hyprland](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/solopasha/hyprland/) for most hyprland-related dependencies, and [hues-sueh/packages](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/heus-sueh/packages/) for matugen. Both provide the `swww` package, so prioritise the former repo:

```bash
sudo dnf copr enable solopasha/hyprland
sudo dnf copr enable heus-sueh/packages
sudo dnf config-manager --save --setopt=copr:copr.fedorainfracloud.org:heus-sueh:packages.priority=200
```

DNF:

```sh
sudo dnf install wireplumber upower libgtop2 bluez bluez-tools grimblast hyprpicker btop NetworkManager wl-clipboard swww brightnessctl gnome-bluetooth aylurs-gtk-shell power-profiles-daemon gvfs nodejs
```

npm:

```bash
npm install -g sass
```

flatpak:

```bash
flatpak install flathub --system com.dec05eba.gpu_screen_recorder
```

#### Optional Dependencies

pip:

```bash
sudo dnf install python python3-pip; pip install gpustat pywal
```

### NixOS

For NixOS/Home-Manager, see [NixOS & Home-Manager instructions](#nixos--home-manager).

## Installation

To install HyprPanel, you can run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jas-SinghFSU/HyprPanel.git
cd HyprPanel
meson setup build
meson compile -C build
meson install -C build
```

### Installing NerdFonts

HyprPanel uses [Nerdfonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) to display icons. You can install them using the following command from within the HyprPanel's `scripts` directory:

```sh
# Installs the JetBrainsMono NerdFonts used for icons
./scripts/install_fonts.sh
```

If you install the fonts after installing HyperPanel, you will need to restart HyperPanel for the changes to take effect.

### NixOS & Home-Manager

Alternatively, if you're using NixOS and/or Home-Manager, you can setup AGS using the provided Nix Flake. First, add the repository to your Flake's inputs, and enable the overlay.

```nix
# flake.nix

{
  inputs.hyprpanel.url = "github:Jas-SinghFSU/HyprPanel";
  # ...

  outputs = { self, nixpkgs, ... }@inputs:
  let
    # ...
	system = "x86_64-linux"; # change to whatever your system should be.
    pkgs = import nixpkgs {
	  inherit system;
	  # ...
	  overlays = [
        inputs.hyprpanel.overlay
	  ];
	};
  in {
    # ...
  }
}
```

Once you've set up the overlay, you can reference HyprPanel with `pkgs.hyprpanel` as if it were any other Nix package. This means you can reference it as a NixOS system/user package, a Home-Manager user package, or as a direct reference in your Hyprland configuration (if your configuration is managed by Home-Manager). The first three methods will add it to your `$PATH` (first globally, second two user-only), however the final will not.

```nix
# configuration.nix

# install it as a system package
environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
  # ...
  hyprpanel
  # ...
];

# or install it as a user package
users.users.<username>.packages = with pkgs; [
  # ...
  hyprpanel
  # ...
];


# home.nix

# install it as a user package with home-manager
home.packages = with pkgs; [
  # ...
  hyprpanel
  # ...
];

# or reference it directly in your Hyprland configuration
wayland.windowManager.hyprland.settings.exec-once = [
  "${pkgs.hyprpanel}/bin/hyprpanel"
];

```

### Launch the panel

Afterwards you can run the panel with the following command in your terminal:

```bash
hyprpanel
```

Or you can add it to your Hyprland config (hyprland.conf) to auto-start with:

```bash
exec-once = hyprpanel
```

### Notifications

HyprPanel handles notifications through the AGS built-in notification service. If you're already using a notification daemon such as Dunst or Mako, you may have to stop them to prevent conflicts with HyprPanel.

> NOTE: If your system is in a language other than English, the resource monitor in the dashboard may not work properly.
